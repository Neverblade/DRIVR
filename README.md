Thanks for taking a look at our project! DRIVR currently supports the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers. Below is information on running and navigating our project.

## Trying the Demo

To just run the demo that you saw in the video, setup the Rift and play the EXE file within the "builds" folder, as you would any other Unity game. The controls are as follows:

* Item Left/Right Grip Trigger: Hold onto the steering wheel
* Item Right Index Trigger: Accelerate
* Item Left Index Trigger: Brake
* Item Left Hand Thumbstick: Toggle turn signal lights (move thumbstick up and down)
* Item Right Hand Button A: Lock turn angle

The other cars will leave you behind at first, but you can catch up to them. Trying changing lanes properly like we did in the video - it's surprisingly difficult.

## Navigating the Code

The full Unity project is located within the "fast-and-furious" folder. Some considerations:

* Item DRIVR was built with Unity 5.5 and so has not been tested for 5.6.
* Item Blender is required to successfuly import the models.

The unity scene that contains the demo is located in the "Assets" folder, and is called "highway". You can also look through the code we wrote in the "Assets/Scripts", or look at the models in "Assets/Models".
