Thanks for taking a look at our project! DRIVR currently supports the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers. Below is information on running and navigating our project.

TRYING THE DEMO

To just run the demo that you saw in the video, setup the Rift and play the EXE file within the "builds" folder, as you would any other Unity game. The controls are as follows:

    Left/Right Grip Trigger: Hold onto the steering wheel
    Right Index Trigger: Accelerate
    Left Index Trigger: Brake
    Left Hand Thumbstick: Toggle turn signal lights (move thumbstick up and down)
    Right Hand Button A: Lock turn angle

The other cars will leave you behind at first, but you can catch up to them. Trying changing lanes properly like we did in the video - it's surprisingly difficult.

ACCESSING THE CODE

The full Unity project is located within the "fast-and-furious" folder.

Prereqs:
    1. DRIVR was built with Unity 5.5 and so has not been tested for 5.6.
    2. Blender is required to successfuly import the models.

The unity scene that contains the demo is located in the "Assets" folder, and is called "highway". You can also look through the code we wrote in the "Assets/Scripts", or look at the models in "Assets/Models".
